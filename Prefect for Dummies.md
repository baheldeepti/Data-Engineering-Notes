## What is Prefect?

Prefect is a modern, Python-native workflow orchestration tool that helps data engineers build, schedule, and monitor data pipelines with ease. It treats your workflows as Python code, enabling dynamic, flexible, and reliable pipelines that scale.

Key concepts:

- **Task:** Smallest unit of work (function decorated with `@task`)  
- **Flow:** Orchestration of tasks into a pipeline (decorated with `@flow`)  
- **State:** Execution status of tasks/flows (e.g., Success, Failed)  
- **Deployment:** Configuration of flow runs and scheduling

## Why Use Prefect? Benefits for Data Engineers

- **Python-first:** Write workflows directly in Python without learning new DSLs.  
- **Robustness:** Built-in retries, timeout, failure handling, and caching.  
- **Observability:** Real-time logs, UI dashboards, and notifications.  
- **Flexibility:** Dynamic branching, mapping, parameters, and more.  
- **Scalability:** Run locally, on Kubernetes, or Prefect Cloud.  
- **Integrations:** Works well with databases, cloud platforms, and messaging systems.

## Common Errors and Mistakes When Using Prefect

| Mistake                                      | Symptom / Error                                   | How to Fix                                            |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing imports (`NameError: task not defined`) | Script fails with NameError                      | Import decorators: `from prefect import task, flow`   |
| Referencing config constants before defining  | `NameError: name 'MY_CONST' is not defined`     | Define all constants at top before usage               |
| Hardcoded values instead of parameters        | Inflexible, not reusable flows                   | Use flow parameters (`@flow def myflow(param): ...`)   |
| No retries or timeouts configured              | Pipelines fail silently or hang indefinitely     | Use `retry` and `timeout` parameters on tasks          |
| Ignoring logs and monitoring                    | Difficult to debug failed pipelines              | Use Prefect UI and logging features                     |
| Mismanaging dependencies                        | Tasks run out of order or with missing data      | Define dependencies explicitly, pass data between tasks|
| Running all tasks locally without scaling      | Local agent blocked by long-running tasks        | Use remote execution environments or Kubernetes agents |

## Step-by-Step Prefect Tutorial

### 1. Install Prefect

```bash
pip install prefect
````

### 2. Define Your Tasks and Flow

Create `etl.py`:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def extract():
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    return data

@task
def transform(data):
    return [i * 10 for i in data]

@task
def load(data):
    print(f"Loaded data: {data}")

@flow
def etl_flow():
    raw_data = extract()
    processed_data = transform(raw_data)
    load(processed_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    etl_flow()
```

### 3. Run Your Flow Locally

```bash
python etl.py
```

You should see:

```
Loaded data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

### 4. Add Parameters

Modify flow to accept parameters:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def extract(n):
    return list(range(n))

@task
def transform(data):
    return [i * 2 for i in data]

@task
def load(data):
    print(f"Loaded data: {data}")

@flow
def etl_flow(n=5):
    raw_data = extract(n)
    processed_data = transform(raw_data)
    load(processed_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    etl_flow(n=10)
```

### 5. Schedule Your Flow (Prefect Cloud or Local)

* For Prefect Cloud: configure a workspace and deployment.
* For local scheduling: use Prefect Orion server and agent.

## Prefect Deployment Strategies

### 1. Local Agent

Run flows on your local machine — great for development and testing.

```bash
prefect agent start --work-queue default
```

### 2. Docker

Package your flows and dependencies in Docker containers for consistent environments.

* Build Docker image with your flow code.
* Run Prefect agent inside Docker or externally.

### 3. Kubernetes

Use Kubernetes agents for scalable, distributed execution.

* Deploy Prefect agents as pods.
* Scale agents horizontally.

### 4. Prefect Cloud

Managed orchestration with UI, alerting, and cloud-native features.

* Connect your flows to Prefect Cloud workspaces.
* Use API tokens and cloud scheduling.

---

## Summary and Best Practices

* Modularize tasks for reuse.
* Parameterize flows for flexibility.
* Handle failures with retries and timeouts.
* Monitor runs with logging and UI.
* Test flows locally before deploying.
* Use appropriate deployment strategy for your scale.
